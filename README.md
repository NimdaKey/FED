Flash Exploit Detector(FED), or named FlashProtector.

A BHO of IE, detect Flash Vector Exploit and print logs in c:\fp\.

You need create c:\fp\ first, and register the BHO to system. And download and build Boost 1.54 by yourself.

It is a tool for researchers not for users. May has some bugs in it.

Detail information is in the PPT file.
